# Widgets

In spare time at work, I like to go on Dribbble and rebound some cool widget ideas. Once I've designed something I like, I will develop it. Generally, due to the fun and quick nature of these;

- Built in Chrome
- Stylistically functional (hovers, etc. but no real functionality)
- Not optimized for all browsers
- Never tested in IE
